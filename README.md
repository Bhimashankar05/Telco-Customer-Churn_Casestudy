# Telco Customer Churn Case Study

I analyzed a dataset related to employee demographics and performance and performed the following steps:  

1. **Data Exploration**: Reviewed the dataset structure, data types, and identified missing values.  
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing data and ensured the dataset was properly formatted for analysis.  
3. **Statistical Insights**: Calculated key metrics, such as churn rates, and performed grouped analyses (e.g., churn rate by customer demographics or service usage).  
4. **Visualization**: Used visual tools to explore distributions, identify trends, and analyze relationships between variables like tenure, services, and churn.  
5. **Documentation**: Compiled findings for clarity, ensuring they are reproducible and ready for sharing on Kaggle or GitHub.
